Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am a data analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Excel and Tableau, and have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data mining, data merging, statistics, and critical thinking.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and presentaions I have created using various tools such as Tableau, and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.

I have also included my work in programming languages such as Python and SQL. These projects showcase my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.

In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.

I am confident that my data analytics skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for any analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing the video streaming dataset (Netflix) for the years 2015-2021.

**Problem Statement:** While analyzing the dataset, we found a sudden dip in the revenue collection and releases of recent movies in the year 2020 by the end of it. Tried to determine the factors which could help Netflix to increase the revenue collection and audience engagement with the platform. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, IMDB score, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Tableau and finding the various factors which could increase the audience engagement.

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types, Normalization, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** MS-Excel, SQL Server, Tableau.

**Dashboard:** ['Dashboard for data analysis on Netflix dataset](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/komal.virk/viz/Netflix_dataset_2015-2021_withBG1/Dashboard1)


### Data Analysis on Traffic Road Accidents.

**Problem Statement:** Analyze the severity of road traffic accidents to understand the factors contributing to high accident rates on a monthly basis. This involves examining:

1. Weather conditions (e.g., wet/damp roads, dry conditions)
2. Time of day (daytime vs. nighttime)
3. Road type (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway)
4. Festival days
5. Additionally, conduct a geographic analysis to identify the city with the highest number of accidents.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, correlation matrices. 

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Presentaion:** [`Presentation on Data Analysis on Traffic Road Accidents](https://onedrive.live.com/personal/b988dd789107950c/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?resid=cf9e24f8-2466-4b06-9dda-b0fb1a4399ab&cid=b988dd789107950c&action=editnew&wdNewAndOpenCt=1719603623357&ct=1719603624280&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.TEMPLATES.NEW&wdPreviousSessionSrc=HarmonyWeb&wdPreviousSession=ab2a19f7-f79a-4eee-ac1e-24fa97e39710)

### Dashboard on Bank Loan Dataset.

**Problem Statement:** Analyze the bank loan dataset to understand the dynamics of loan performance. The analysis aims to differentiate between good loans and bad loans, evaluate the total amount received, calculate the average interest rate, and examine loan status. The dashboard will be divided into three sections:

Summary: Provide an overview of the key metrics, including the total number of loans, total amount received, and average interest rate. Highlight the distribution of good and bad loans and visualize the overall loan performance.
Overview: Analyzing the factors which impact the total loan applocations
Details: Offer a detailed analysis of loan statuses and other relevant factors contributing to loan performance.

**Skills:** Data Connection and Integration, Data Preparation, Data Visualization.  

**Technology:** Tableau, MS-Excel.
